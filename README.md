# Todo Client

Created a To-Do application using React to build a responsive and interactive user interface. Used Redux for managing the appâ€™s state efficiently, ensuring smooth performance and easy data handling. Incorporated React Icons to provide clear and simple icons for better user navigation. Designed the app with Tailwind CSS to achieve a modern, clean, and responsive layout that works across all devices. Integrated Toaster to display notifications, making the app more user-friendly by alerting users with helpful messages in an easy-to-understand way.
